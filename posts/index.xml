      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You just fight to live another day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just after completing my term as an Innovation Committee Lead for ITDP Hyderabad, I got an opportunity to work with the DELL TIDE Hackathon team. It was sheer coincidence that I met the right person at the right place, at the right time, with the right response. Little did I know back then that it would have such a profound impact on my work life. In this blog post, I will be journaling about my experience conducting my first Hackathon for Dell India and Malaysia in association with Dell TIDE Team. Letâ€™s get started.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Perfection Is Overrated</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Practice makes Perfect&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dhirajbalakrishnan.dev/images/Perfection.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Perfection&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have a confession to make, I have been writing and re-writing this post for over two months now. During this interim, the blogâ€™s title has changed thrice and the blog content has changed so much that the initial draft is nowhere close to this post. Having said this, you might be wondering why, and I donâ€™t blame you for it. After all, this has been a real pain point for me and at one point I thought this is impossible for me to accomplish. Trust me, by the end of this post you will get to know why it took so long for me in the first place, but, if you are in the same boat as I was, I hope this will give you a reason to break out of this vicious infinite loop.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
